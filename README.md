[**Analyzing NYC High Schools Scores**](https://github.com/sunnyyan97/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20NYC%20High%20School%20Scores.ipynb)

In this project, I explored relationships between SAT Scores and NYC Demographic Factors in New York City Public High Schools. I used Pandas to read in the various datasets, cleaned them and then combined the datasets into one file for easy analysis. Then I created a few scatter plots to easily visualize the relationships between SAT Scores and various Demographic Factors
