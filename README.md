# Data Science Portfolio

This is a repository containing Sunny Yan's portfolio of Data Science Projects. Projects are presented in Jupyter Notebooks using Python and SQL. Many of the project prompts are from the Data Engineering and Data Analyst Paths in [Dataquest.](https://www.dataquest.io/)

## Projects

[**Building a Postgres Database for Crime Reports**](https://github.com/sunnyyan97/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Database%20for%20Crime%20Reports.ipynb)

In this project, I built a Postgres database for storing data related to crimes in Boston. Within this database, I create a schema and tables, as well as users and groups to grant permissions. I also optimize each column of this database to improve run times and storage needed.

[**Analyzing NYC High Schools Scores**](https://github.com/sunnyyan97/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20NYC%20High%20School%20Scores.ipynb)

In this project, I explored relationships between SAT Scores and NYC Demographic Factors in New York City Public High Schools. I used Python and the Pandas module to read in the various datasets, cleaned them and then combined the datasets into one file for easy analysis. Then I created a few scatter plots to easily visualize the relationships between SAT Scores and various Demographic Factors.

[**Answering Business Questions with SQL**](https://github.com/sunnyyan97/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Answering%20Business%20Questions%20with%20SQL%20(1).ipynb)

For this project I used SQL to answer business questions about a record store, with the SQLite module within Python. Using the Chinook database, I defined functions in order to run queries and commands and wrote several advanced SQL queries, including subqueries, CTEs and multiple joins.

[**CIA Factbook Analysis with SQL**](https://github.com/sunnyyan97/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/CIA%20Factbook%20Analysis%20with%20SQL%20(1).ipynb)

In this project, I query a SQLite database in order to analyze CIA factbook data about countries in the world.

[**Analyzing Lottery Probabilities**](https://github.com/sunnyyan97/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20Lottery%20Probabilities.ipynb)

In this project, I used Python to analyze different probabilities of winning the lottery using historical data from the national 6/49 lottery in Canada. Questions answered include: What is the probability of winning the lottery with one ticket? 40 tickets? And what is the probability of getting 5 out of 6 winning numbers?

[**Exploring Posts on Hacker News**](https://github.com/sunnyyan97/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Exploring%20Posts%20on%20Hacker%20News.ipynb)

For this project I used Python to analyze posts from Hacker News, a computer science and entrepreneurship social website founded by Y Combinator. The purpose of this project was to discover which types of posts get the highest amount of engagement and which hours are the best times to post.

[**Finding Best Markets to Advertise In**](https://github.com/sunnyyan97/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Finding%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise.ipynb)

In this project, I pretend to be a data analyst at an e-learning company looking to promote and advertise their product. I use Python to analyze and clean a dataset survey of new coders, removing outliers and creating data visualizations of statistic fundamentals to find the two best markets to advertise in. 

[**Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings**](https://github.com/sunnyyan97/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Investigating%20Fandango%20Movie%20Ratings.ipynb)

In this project, I investigate the effect of FiveThirtyEight's [claim](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) that Fandango artificially inflates movie ratings. The goal is to see if Fandango is still inflating their ratings post-publication of the article. I use Python to analyze two datasets containing review score data before and after the article was published. I then created data visualizations of summary statistics to compare the datasets. 

[**Profitable App Profiles**](https://github.com/sunnyyan97/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Profitable%20App%20Profiles.ipynb)

In this project I used Python to analyze a dataset of Android and iOS mobile apps for sale on their respective app store markets. I recommend the type of app that should be built on each platform that would have the highest potential profitability. To do this I cleaned the data by removing duplicate and non-English apps, and then created frequency tables to easily visualize the data.
