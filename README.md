# Data-Science-Portfolio

This is a repository containing Sunny Yan's portfolio of Data Science Projects. Projects are presented in Jupyter Notebooks using Python and SQL. Many of the project prompts are from the Data Engineering and Data Scientist Paths in [Dataquest.](https://www.dataquest.io/)

## Projects

[**Analyzing NYC High Schools Scores**](https://github.com/sunnyyan97/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20NYC%20High%20School%20Scores.ipynb)

In this project, I explored relationships between SAT Scores and NYC Demographic Factors in New York City Public High Schools. I used Pandas to read in the various datasets, cleaned them and then combined the datasets into one file for easy analysis. Then I created a few scatter plots to easily visualize the relationships between SAT Scores and various Demographic Factors

[**Answering Business Questions with SQL**](https://github.com/sunnyyan97/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Answering%20Business%20Questions%20with%20SQL.ipynb)

For this project I used SQL to answer business questions about a record store, with the SQLite module within Python. Using the Chinook database, I defined functions in order to run queries and commands and wrote several advanced SQL queries, including subqueries, CTEs and multiple joins.

[**Analyzing Lottery Probabilities**]

In this project, I used Python to analyze different probabilities of winning the lottery using historical data from the national 6/49 lottery in Canada. Questions answered include: What is the probability of winning the lottery with one ticket? 40 tickets? And what is the probability of getting 5 out of 6 winning numbers?
